When deciding whether to use `@Controller` or `@RestController`, consider the nature of the response you want to return from your Spring MVC controller.

### Use `@Controller` When:

1. **Rendering Views**: If your application needs to render HTML views and return them to the client, then `@Controller` is the appropriate choice. It's typically used in traditional server-rendered web applications.

2. **Server-side Logic**: When your controller needs to perform additional server-side logic, such as redirecting to different URLs, handling form submissions, or managing sessions, `@Controller` is more suitable.

3. **Model and View**: `@Controller` is often paired with the `ModelAndView` class to pass data to the view for rendering. This approach is commonly used in applications following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

### Use `@RestController` When:

1. **API Endpoints**: If your application primarily serves as an API provider and needs to return data in JSON or XML format, then `@RestController` is the better choice. It's optimized for RESTful web services.

2. **Simplified Response Handling**: `@RestController` eliminates the need to annotate every handler method with `@ResponseBody`. It automatically converts return values to JSON or XML and writes them directly to the HTTP response body.

3. **Stateless Services**: When building stateless services or microservices that communicate over HTTP and require minimal server-side processing, `@RestController` provides a cleaner and more concise approach.

### Example:

Suppose you're building a web application where users can retrieve information about books:

- If the application serves HTML pages where users can browse and interact with book listings, you'd use `@Controller` to handle requests, render HTML views, and manage server-side logic.

- However, if the application exposes an API endpoint `/api/books` that returns a list of books in JSON format, you'd use `@RestController` to handle the request and return the list of books directly as JSON.

### Summary:

- Use `@Controller` for server-side rendering, managing views, and handling traditional web application workflows.
- Use `@RestController` for building RESTful APIs, serving JSON or XML responses, and simplifying the handling of HTTP requests and responses.
